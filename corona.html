                    <b><center>New Delhi: Amid the continuous surge in COVID-19 cases, six states have managed to conduct the third phase of the vaccination on Saturday (May 1) drive while other states have deferred due to a shortage of COVID-19 vaccine supplies.</b></center><br><br>

            <b><center>Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat and Odisha are the six states who have announced that they will begin vaccinations for the 18-44 age group on Saturday (May 1).</b></center><br><br>
            
            <b><center>The shortage in vaccines still proves to be an issue as these states have  distributed a small amount of vaccines to their districts and will not be able to cater to most of the population in their states.<br><br>

                    Three big private hospital chains, Apollo, Fortis and Max, announced the launch of COVID-19 immunisation drive for the 18-44 age group at limited centres in the country from May 1 while the Delhi government said it will start the vaccination exercise once it receives doses from the manufacturers.</center></b>
