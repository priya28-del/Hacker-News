                    <p>Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy wrote: “The leaders of the political parties should keep the rank and file in check and ensure that there is no bursting of crackers or taking out of rallies, particularly on the day of counting, and till such time that the present grim situation continues. Leaders of political parties are requested to take a proactive stand in such regard and lead by example.”</p><br><br>
<p>The interim orders were passed on a suo motu public interest litigation petition taken up by the court to monitor the COVID-19 situation in the State. Observing that the counting day was the immediate concern, the judges hoped that the political parties, media personnel and citizens would strictly adhere to the COVID-19 protocol laid down by the Election Commission of India and the State government.</p><br><br>

<p>The court wanted all stakeholders to scrupulously follow the norms and cooperate with the authorities in the greater public interest.</p></center></b></div>
